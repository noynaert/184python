Moving through the 184 material

From the email:

I've already committed to using an open source textbook for CSC184 in the Fall and I've been looking through the options. I'm setting in on this one:

I feel it's about the right level of detail, and though the topic ordering isn't 100% ideal for me, I think I can work with it. I'm also going to use Anaconda instead of PyCharm for projects and I adopted Turingscraft codelab for exercises (until code cafe is up to snuff). I'm curious if any of you have thoughts on the book, and I also encourage you to read it this Summer to help you see what the students will be learning in CSC184 now.

This also got me thinking more about our use of open source textbooks. Are any of the rest of you looking in to any? I found an interesting development here:

This organization (CSforALL) helps publicize efforts to make CS more accessible to more students. Certainly adopting open source textbooks counts. I'd like to consider submitting a commitment on our behalf to this organization for our department to be publicized. To that end, any consideration any of you have had towards open source textbooks would be good to know. This is a good starting point if you're looking for one:

We could also start thinking a little more seriously about outreach and perhaps include something like that in a commitment as well. Let me know if this is something that interests you.
